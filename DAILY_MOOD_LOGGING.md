# Daily Mood Logging Feature

## Overview
The VibeLoop application now includes a daily mood logging system that allows users to log their mood once per day. This feature helps users track their emotional well-being over time while maintaining data integrity through daily limits.

## Key Features

### 1. Daily Limit Enforcement
- **One log per day**: Users can only log their mood once per calendar day
- **User-specific**: Each user has their own daily limit, independent of other users
- **Date-based**: The limit is enforced based on the calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### 2. Visual Indicators
- **Calendar view**: Days with logged moods are highlighted with green background and a green dot indicator
- **Today indicator**: Current day is highlighted with a blue ring
- **Existing log display**: When viewing a day that already has a log, the form is replaced with a success message showing the existing entry

### 3. User Experience
- **Clear messaging**: Users receive informative messages when they try to log more than once per day
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages for various failure scenarios
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate visual feedback when logs are successfully saved

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. S3 Service Updates (`lib/s3-service.ts`)
- Added `userId` field to mood log structure
- New functions:
  - `getUserMoodLogs(userId)`: Get all logs for a specific user
  - `hasUserLoggedForDate(userId, date)`: Check if user has logged for a specific date
  - `getUserMoodLogForDate(userId, date)`: Get user's log for a specific date

#### 2. API Updates (`app/api/mood-log/route.ts`)
- **POST endpoint**: Now requires authentication and enforces daily limits
- **GET endpoint**: Returns user-specific logs or logs for a specific date
- **Authentication**: Uses Clerk for user identification
- **Validation**: Checks for existing logs before allowing new entries

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Mood Calendar (`app/mood-calendar/page.tsx`)
- Enhanced calendar display with visual indicators
- Form validation and error handling
- Existing log display when user has already logged for a day
- Informational banner explaining the daily limit

#### 2. Suggestions Page (`app/suggestions/page.tsx`)
- Updated mood logging to respect daily limits
- Improved error messaging with custom notifications
- Better user feedback for limit violations

## Data Structure

### Mood Log Object
```typescript
{
  emoji: string;        // Mood emoji (ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜¢, etc.)
  text: string;         // Mood description
  time: string;         // ISO timestamp
  userId: string;       // User identifier from Clerk
}
```

### Storage
- Mood logs are stored as JSON files in S3
- File naming: `mood-logs/mood_{timestamp}_{random}.json`
- Each log includes the user ID for proper filtering

## User Flow

1. **First-time logging**: User can log their mood for any day
2. **Subsequent attempts**: If user tries to log for the same day again:
   - API returns error with `alreadyLogged: true`
   - Frontend shows appropriate message
   - Existing log is displayed instead of form
3. **Calendar view**: Days with logs are visually distinguished
4. **Cross-page consistency**: Daily limit is enforced across all pages

## Security & Privacy

- **User isolation**: Users can only see and modify their own mood logs
- **Authentication required**: All mood logging operations require valid user session
- **Data validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of authentication failures

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the daily mood logging system:

1. **Mood analytics**: Charts and trends based on logged moods
2. **Mood categories**: Predefined mood categories with associated emojis
3. **Mood streaks**: Track consecutive days of logging
4. **Export functionality**: Allow users to export their mood data
5. **Mood reminders**: Optional daily reminders to log mood
6. **Mood sharing**: Optional sharing of mood with friends/family

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive logic testing for:
- Date extraction and comparison
- User-specific log filtering
- Daily limit enforcement
- Cross-day validation

All core functionality has been tested and verified to work correctly.
