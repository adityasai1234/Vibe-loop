## Data Structure

The application uses Firebase Firestore with the following structure:

```
moods/
  😊_happy/
    songs/
      songId/
        title: "Happy"
        artist: "Pharrell Williams"
        url: "https://..."
        genre: "Pop"
        mood: "happy"
        emoji: "😊"
  😢_sad/
    songs/
      ...
```

User data is stored as:

```
users/{uid}/lastMood: "😊"
users/{uid}/favorites: [songIds]
users/{uid}/moodHistory: [{mood, timestamp}]
```
