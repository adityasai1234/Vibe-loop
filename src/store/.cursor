  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
  - Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
  - Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
  - Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  Naming Conventions:
  - Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
  - Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
  - Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  JavaScript Usage:
  - Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects.
  - Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.
  - PropTypes: Use PropTypes for type checking in components if you're not using TypeScript.

  Performance Optimization:
  - Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.
  - Memoization: Use React.memo() for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - FlatList Optimization: Optimize FlatList with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.
  - Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

  UI and Styling:
  - Consistent Styling: Use StyleSheet.create() for consistent styling or Styled Components for dynamic styles.
  - Responsive Design: Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Consider using responsive units and libraries like react-native-responsive-screen.
  - Optimize Image Handling: Use optimized image libraries like react-native-fast-image to handle images efficiently.

  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's Threading Model: Be aware of how React Native handles threading to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Use Expo Tools: Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  - Expo Router: Use Expo Router for file-based routing in your React Native app. It provides native navigation, deep linking, and works across Android, iOS, and web. Refer to the official documentation for setup and usage: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/

  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
  - Use functional components and hooks over class components.
  - Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
  - Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.
  
  Naming Conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
  - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
  - Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
  
  TypeScript Usage:
  - Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
  - Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
  - Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
  - Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.
  
  Performance Optimization:
  - Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
  - Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Optimize FlatLists with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize`.
  - Use `getItemLayout` for FlatLists when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
  - Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
  
  UI and Styling:
  - Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
  - Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like `react-native-fast-image`.
  
  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  - Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.
